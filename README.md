<h1>Chatbot </h1>

<h5>As part of my practice with natural language processing, I recently built a chatbot using Hugging Face's open-source models. Hugging Face offers a vast array of models, making it an excellent resource for anyone looking to explore NLP.
In this project, I focused on setting up a conversational pipeline using the transformers library. It was a great way to get hands-on experience with these tools and understand how to create a functional chatbot.
If you're also exploring NLP or working with transformers, this might resonate with your experiences. </h5>
